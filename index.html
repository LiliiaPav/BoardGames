            <h2>Our Collection</h2>
            <p>The world of board games is huge. In our collection, we have only some options but we are always glad to throw a double six.</p>
            <p>In our list, we have games of different genres, different ages, and difficulties. But many modern games are friendly to families and newcomers to the hobby. Learn more about <a href="pages/library.html"> our library.</a>

            <p>Board games could be short and you can play them during the party. They can take less than 30 minutes so nobody will be tired and you can finish a game. The average time for the game is 45-60 minutes. But a lot of great games go well above that time. Some people believe that long games have more rich strategies and provide a more rewarding experience.</p>

            <h2>From 3 to 103</h2>
            <p>Every day we have to do so many things, we gun, and run, and runâ€¦ But sometimes we can find time just to gather together and spend some time as a family. Not all games fit any age and sometimes it could be tricky to find a game that is fun for everyone. We have several family games and some of them can play even toddlers. </p>
